        <h1>Welcome to Linux From Scratch!</h1>
        <p>Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.</p>
        <p>Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following subprojects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LFS</strong>: Linux From Scratch is the main book, the base from which all other projects are derived.</li>
            <li><strong>BLFS</strong>: Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you extend your finished LFS installation into a more customized and usable system.</li>
            <li><strong>ALFS</strong>: Automated Linux From Scratch provides tools for automating and managing LFS and BLFS builds.</li>
            <li><strong>MLFS</strong>: Multilib-LFS is a variant of LFS that builds a system which is able to execute 32-bit binaries.</li>
            <li><strong>GLFS</strong>: Gaming Linux From Scratch is based on LFS and helps you install gaming support software like Steam or Wine on LFS or MLFS system.</li>
            <li><strong>Hints</strong>: The Hints project is a collection of documents that explain how to enhance your LFS system in ways that are not included in the LFS or BLFS books.</li>
            <li><strong>Patches</strong>: The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user.</li>
            <li><strong>LFS Editor's Guide</strong>: A document that describes the LFS development process.</li>
            <li><strong>Museum</strong>: Copies of ancient LFS and BLFS versions.</li>
        </ul>
